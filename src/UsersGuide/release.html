&browser.name; &release.version; has been qualified on 
JavaOS<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 1.1 
and Solaris<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 2.6 operating systems,
running on SPARC<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font>-based platforms. 
<p>
<a name=changes></a>
<h2>Changes Since Last Release</h2>
&browser.name; &release.version; is a major update from 
HotJava Browser 1.1.5. The version number 3.0 indicates that
this product has comparable HTML support as other popular 3.0
browsers.

<p>
Changes of particular significance are:

<ul>
<li>
The JavaScript<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> language is now supported. 
<a href="javascript.html">JavaScript</a> adds interactive capabilities to 
web pages, which may interact with forms, buttons, applets, or active images.  
&browser.name; &release.version; aims to be compatible with the 
Netscape Navigator<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 
3.0 object model and the ECMAScript 1.4 language specification.

<p>
<li>The user interface and graphics have been significantly redesigned. 
<p> 

<li>Hundreds of bugs have been fixed.
<p>

<li>HTML rendering is much more flexible. Pages display more closely to the
way they are displayed in other popular browsers.

<p>
<li>The Show HTML Errors option from 1.x releases is no longer available.
Since &browser.name; &release.version; is much more forgiving of pages that do
not strictly conform to the HTML standard specifications, the concept 
of HTML errors in &browser.name; has lost much of its meaning.  
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name="general"></a>
<dd><b>General Problems</b>

<ul>
<li>
Clicking on the Stop button sometimes yields slow response. In particular, 
if &browser.name; is making a network connection to fetch images, the 
Stop button cannot interrupt that connection. (4223963)
<p>

<li>
Extremely long pages might not display completely on platforms other
than the JavaStation<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> platform.  (4059963)
<p>

<li>
If you delete items from the Certifying Authority Certificates list (on the
Security Preferences dialog box), and you then click Cancel to change your
mind, the deleted items do not appear on the list again until you exit and 
restart the browser. (4228761)  
<p>

<li>
If you navigate away from a page with animated GIF images, then return to it
(for example, via the Back button), the animated GIF images will be refetched
once from the network, causing extra unexpected network activity.
<p>

<li>
If you add invalid values for the SOCKS host and port values on the Proxies
Preferences panel, including <i>any</i> values if SOCKS is not installed on your
network, &browser.name; will not be able to access any sites outside of your
firewall.  The SOCKS settings override all protocol proxy settings, and if
&browser.name; can't connect using a specified SOCKS proxy host, the connection
attempt fails.  If you are not using a SOCKS server, do not fill in the SOCKS
fields on the Proxies Preferences page.
<p>

</ul>

<a name="navigate"></a>
<dd><b>Navigation Problems</b>
<ul>
<li>
Internal links sometimes do not work until you click on them twice.  If you 
use links on a page to navigate within that same page, and then use the Back 
and Forward buttons, internal links (that is, links that take you to another 
place on the same page) will no longer work on the first click.
<p>
To work around this problem, click on the internal link twice or reload the
page. (4225548)
<p>

<li>
The Back and Forward buttons may take you to incorrect pages after you 
have navigated around a page using internal links.
<p>

<li>
If you navigate to a page with nested frames (that is, frames within frames), 
and you then navigate within the nested frames, the Reload button may not work 
as expected.  Instead of reloading only the current frame within the nested
frames, the original frameset is reloaded, taking you "back" further than you 
may have intended. (4228584)
<p>

<li>
Sometimes surplus characters are appended at the end of a new URL.
If you are in the middle of loading a page with a long URL in the address 
field, and you double-click the URL to replace it with a shorter one, 
extra characters may be appended to the new URL.
This is most likely to happen if you have a slow connection. (4210335)
<p>

</ul>

<p>
<a name="scroll"></a>
<dd><b>Scrolling Problems</b>

<ul>
<li>
If you navigate away from a page with frames (such as the User's Guide Index),
and then return to it with the Back button, the frame scrollbars may 
disappear.  You can work around this problem by resizing the page. The
scrollbars will then return. (4226749)
<p>

<li>
Sometimes Page Up, Page Down, and arrow keys do not automatically work to 
scroll the page.  Click inside the content window or address field to enable 
these keyboard keys.
(4222264)
<p>

<li>(Windows platforms only) Scrolling by dragging the scrollbar thumb can 
cause many repaints and "smearing" of the page.  Redisplay the page to correct 
the display if necessary.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="printing"></a>
<dd><b>Printing Problems</b>

<ul>
<li>
Some pages may have their content truncated on the right side when
printed. This happens on pages with very wide text or images, such as pages
with non-breaking or preformatted text, or pages with tables of a
large predetermined width.
<p>
Try printing the page in Landscape mode.  Unless the page is extremely
wide, chances are the page can be printed completely in Landscape mode.
(4178304)

<p>
<li>
Pages may be printed with fonts that are slightly larger than you
might expect.

</ul>

<p>
<a name="bookmarks"></a>
<dd><b>Bookmark Problems</b>

<ul>
<li>
When you add a new bookmark, it is correctly added in the Edit Bookmarks
window and it is added to the end of the Bookmarks menu, but it is not
immediately added in the 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->Go to Bookmark->Personal Bookmarks</nobr>
pullright menu.  The new bookmark will appear in this menu after you exit
and restart the browser.
<p>

<li>
Newly added bookmarks are added to the end of the Bookmarks menu even if
you have disabled the "Show Personal Bookmarks in Bookmarks Menu" option.
If that option is disabled, the new bookmarks will disappear from 
the Bookmarks menu and be added to the 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->Go to Bookmark->Personal Bookmarks</nobr> pullright menu
after you exit and restart the browser. 

<!--
<li>
Bookmark lists may occasionally become corrupted.  If you find that your 
set of bookmark lists is suddenly incomplete or missing, exit and restart
the browser.  Your bookmark lists might then be corrected.

<p>
If exiting and restarting the browser does not correct the problem, exit
the browser,
remove the file hotlist.html from the .hotjava subdirectory of your home 
directory (if it exists), 
and then restart the browser to regenerate the basic set of bookmark lists,
and the Netscape<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> bookmarks.
This will <i>not</i> regenerate bookmarks lost from the Personal Bookmarks or 
Cool Bookmarks lists, however, so those bookmarks will be lost.
<p>
Also, if you have lost bookmarks, look in the .hotjava subdirectory for 
"backup" hotlist files. &browser.name; may have saved an uncorrupted version 
of your hotlist in a backup file, which will be called 
"hotlist.html.&lt;<i>number</i>&gt;".  If so, 
rename the backup hotlist file to "hotlist.html" and restart the 
browser.
-->
</ul>

<p>
<a name="applets"></a>
<dd><b>Applet Problems</b>
<ul>

<li>
Due to the &browser.name; security manager, some
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html">Swing</a> applets will 
not work in &browser.name;.  Swing applets may also cause the browser to hang.
(4125348, 4123604)
<p>

<li>
If applets are disabled when you initially load them, and you then 
enable applets (using <nobr><wbr>Edit->Security Preferences),</nobr>
sometimes the applets still won't run after you reload the page.
If this happens, you'll need to exit and restart &browser.name; in
order for the applets to run. (4226974)
<p>

<li>
(JavaOS platforms only) The pop-up certificate window shows duplicate entries 
for each signed applet certificate.  If you choose the first certificate in any 
pair of duplicates, the signed applet will not be allowed to run.  
<p>
<i>Always choose the second certificate</i> in each pair of duplicate 
certificates.  (4216506)

</ul>

<p>
<a name="javascript"></a>
<dd><b>JavaScript Problems</b>
<ul>

<p>
<li>
&browser.name; cannot always display the page my.netscape.com.
This site contains JavaScript that essentially causes &browser.name; 
to continually reload the page.  In some cases &browser.name; settles 
down after a while, sometimes displaying the page, and sometimes not.
(4217945)

<p>
<li>
HTML tags created by document<b>.</b>write are not immediately
accessable to JavaScript.  The following script demonstrates this behavior:
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
document.write('&lt;FORM NAME="myform" METHOD="GET"'+
	       ' ACTION="foo.html&gt;');
document.write('&lt;INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="mytext"&gt;');
document.write('&lt;/FORM&gt;');
document.myform.mytext.value="Hi there";
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

The attempt to access <nobr><wbr>document<b>.</b>myform<b>.</b>mytext</nobr> 
inside the script in which it is created will fail.  This is due to the 
way <nobr><wbr>document<b>.</b>write</nobr> is handled by &browser.name;.  
When the &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; tag is seen, &browser.name; executes the script 
to the end, but does not continue parsing the document until the script is 
finished.  Thus the HTML inserted by the 
<nobr><wbr>document<b>.</b>write</nobr> calls will not be available to 
the script, and thus the object 
<nobr><wbr>document<b>.</b>myform<b>.</b>mytext</nobr> does not yet exist.
(4206164)

<p>
<li>
Setting the alinkColor, vlinkColor, linkColor and bgColor of a
JavaScript document object will not dynamically update the colors.  
The value will be saved in the property as normal, however.

<p>
<li>
For information on creating web pages containing Y2K-Compliant JavaScript, see 
the description of the getYear() method in the JavaScript Exceptions document in 
the administrator documentation shipped with &browser.name;.  This can 
normally be found in the directory <tt>admin-docs</tt> where your browser is
installed.
</ul>


<p>
<a name="l10n"></a>
<dd><b>Localization Problems</b>

<ul>

<li>In the Korean (ko) and Traditional Chinese (zh_TW.Big5) locales, &browser.name;
users cannot input ASCII characters into text fields such as the input fields
for Proxy port settings.  There is no problem in the Address field or multiline 
text areas.  (4174652) 
<p>
This is probably the result of an AWT text area bug (4094365) in the JDK in which
monospace fonts do not display on certain locales.
<p>
There are two possible workarounds:
<p>
Run &browser.name; in the C locale:
<pre>
    % env LANG=C /opt/SUNWhjb/runbrowser
</pre>

<i>Or</i>
<p>
Change the fontset in the font properties file.  For example, in the Korean
locale, you would edit <tt>./opt/SUNWhjb/runtime/lib/font.properties.ko</tt>
and change:
<pre>
fontset.monospaced.plain=-sun-kodig-medium-r-normal--*-%d-*-*-c-*-ksc5636-0,
-sun-kodig-medium-r-normal--*-%d-*-*-c-*-ksc5601.1987-0
</pre>
<i>to:</i>
<pre>
fontset.monospaced.plain=-sun-gothic-medium-r-normal--*-%d-*-*-c-*-ksc5636-0,
-sun-kodig-medium-r-normal--*-%d-*-*-c-*-ksc5636-0,-sun-kodig-medium-r-normal
--*-%d-*-*-c-*-ksc5601.1987-0
</pre>

<p>
<li>(Solaris only) &browser.name; ships with a version of the 
Java Runtime Environment that does not provide support for the euro
currency symbol.  (4215366)

<p>
In order to get euro currency character support, 
you will need to make sure your Solaris operating environment has the
euro currency symbol support, and you'll need to use a more recent 
version of the JRE when running &browser.name;. The following steps 
should be taken:
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Ensure that the Solaris installation is capable of producing the
euro currency symbol, for example, in a terminal window or a mail message. 
If not, you probably need to install extra packages to the OS (if using
Solaris 7), or download patches that provide euro character support for
Solaris 2.6 or 2.5.1 operating environments.
<p>
Contact your Solaris provider for more information, or visit the Sun
site for information about the 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/solaris/euro/">euro currency</a> requirements
and patches. 
<p>
Once you've downloaded and installed the required patches, you'll need to
exit the windowing system and choose one of the euro locales from the
login language-chooser dialog.  At this point you should be able to
produce the euro currency symbol on your system.

<p>
<li>
Download and install the latest <a href="http://www.sun.com/solaris/jre/"> 
Java Runtime Environment 1.1 Solaris release</a>.  (At the time these release
notes were written, this is Solaris_JRE_1.1.7_06, which does provide support 
for the euro currency symbol.)

<p>
<li>
Run the HotJava Browser installer, and choose the option to use a
virtual machine already installed on your machine instead of the default
JRE shipped with &browser.name;.  For example, if you installed the 1.1.7
JRE in <tt>/usr/local/java</tt>, then pick the binary 
<tt>/usr/local/java/Solaris_JRE_1.1.7_06/bin/jre</tt> at the "Choose 
another virtual machine" option in the installer.
