<p>

The following table provides information about 
Java<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> applet and 
JavaScript<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> behavior allowed at each security 
level in 
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix;.  

<p>
The Unprotected security level is only available on the Special Cases Security 
Preferences panel.  The Blocked security level is applied on the
Applets and JavaScript panel when you unset Enable Applets, Enable 
JavaScript, or both options.

<p>
The information in this table describes common applet or JavaScript behavior, 
relevant to most users.  If you are a Java applet or JavaScript developer 
interested in details about additional technical restrictions at the 
various security levels (for example, accessing properties and manipulating 
threads), see the security documentation shipped with the
&browser.name; Administrator documents.

<p>
Note that in addition to the tangible protections described below,
the Java language and &browser.name; work together to enforce other 
constraints on JavaScript and Java applets
to make them run in a safe fashion.  For example, applets are not
permitted to send messages to windows that cause them to be closed
(except windows the applet has created on its own).

<b>Permissions listed as "Warn" have the following behavior:</b>
<blockquote>
Each time JavaScript or a Java applet attempts one of the listed actions, 
(for example, read a file), &browser.name; checks its list of previously 
granted permissions.  If the specific permission has been previously granted, 
it is allowed.  Otherwise, you are queried through a dialog box to choose 
from either allowing this specific action (read the specified file), allowing 
all similar actions (read <i>any</i> file), or blocking the action (deny 
reading this file this time).
</blockquote>

<b>Footnotes:</b>
<p>
1: JavaScript and applets with Ask First or Restricted security that are 
loaded using the file protocol have read access (without warning) to files 
in the directory from which they were loaded.
<p>
2: JavaScript and applets with Restricted security may accept connections from 
their originating site, but no others.
<p>
3: Javascript and applets with Restricted security may connect to their 
originating site, but no others.
<p>
4: You are warned and can deny permission when an applet attempts any network
access <i>except</i> when connecting to the applet's original site.
<p>
5: Windows created by JavaScript or applets with Restricted or Ask First 
security will show a warning banner at the top of the window.
