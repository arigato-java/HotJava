<h2>Security Preferences</h2>

When you use a browser to visit web sites and submit data to a web server 
(for example, when you use a web site for online shopping), you may be 
concerned about a handful of security issues.  Use the
<nobr><wbr>Edit->Security Preferences</nobr> dialog box to specify your 
security preferences.

<p>
For example, you might want to control if and when the browser writes 
small bits of information (called <i>cookies</i>) on your machine about 
the web sites you visit or the actions you perform at a particular site.
Or, you might want to make sure that the information you send during an
online shopping session can only be read by the intended receiver.

<p>
Another security issue is how much access you want to give to programs 
included on web sites you visit.
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix; 
can run executable content in the form of 
JavaScript<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> commands or 
Java<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> applets,
which are programs that can be included in an HTML page, much like images can
be included. You can be sure that JavaScript and Java applets running in 
&browser.name; cannot inspect or change any of the files on your local system 
or otherwise violate your system privacy without your permission. By default, 
&browser.name; provides a secure environment for Java applets and JavaScript to 
run in, but you can allow more permissions and thus give the programs more 
power to do interesting things if you trust the program's source. 

<p>
The security options provided on the Security Preferences dialog box 
depend on whether you are using the <b>Basic</b> or <b>Advanced</b> 
Security Administration Mode, as specified at the top of the Security 
Preferences dialog box. The Security Administration Mode tells &browser.name; 
how much and what type of security information you want to control.  
Basic mode allows you access and control over security information that 
you normally need to use your browser.  Choose Advanced if you need more 
fine-tuned and detailed control over security features such as applet and 
JavaScript permissions, certificates, and SSL ciphers.

<p>
<a name=cookies></a>
<hr>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
Cookies are small bits of information that the browser saves on your 
system at the request of a web server.  The purpose of cookies is to store 
information for a particular web site.  This information might be used to 
save the state of the web site the last time you visited it, profile 
information about you and the requests you've made, user preferences, 
registration information, and so on.  

<p>
For example, if you're using a web site to read newsgroups, that site might
use cookies to remember where you last left off reading.  A stock page
might use cookies to note what stocks or mutual funds you want to see
information about.  

<p>
Some cookies are saved in memory only for the current browser session. 
Other cookies are <i>persistent</i>, meaning they are saved to disk
for a specified period of time, which may extend past your current session.

<p>
Although cookies can be sent to the server where the web
site that set them resides, <i>only</i> the cookie information set by that
web site can be sent.  Cookies do not allow web servers to access other 
files on your system.

<p>
Many web sites that request cookies can still be viewed without setting the 
cookies, but some cannot.  If you choose not to set any cookies or a 
particular cookie, you may be blocked from viewing some sites, some sites
might look incomplete, or you may have only limited access to some sites.

<p>
Use the options in the Cookies section to tell &browser.name; which of the
following options you prefer:

<ul>
<li>Allow cookies to be set without notice, and thus without interruption.
(Accept all cookies)
<li>Ask your permission each time a site wants to set a cookie. (Notify
me before accepting each cookie)
<li>Disable cookies altogether, and do not notify me when they are 
encountered. (Do not accept cookies)
</ul>

<p>
If you choose to be notified when cookies are set, you'll see a dialog box 
each time a server wants to set a cookie.  It includes information about 
the cookie, including when the cookie will expire.  If you select the 
check box "Don't show this message in the future," &browser.name; will 
accept all cookies in the future without notification.  You can change 
your mind about this at any time by changing the Cookies option on the 
Security Preferences dialog box.

<p>
At any time, you can click the <b>Discard Cookies</b> button to delete all
information you currently have stored in cookies.  All cookies will be
deleted at once.

</TABLE>


Java applets are small programs included on some web pages that &browser.name; 
downloads to your computer when you access that page. These programs 
are executable code that runs on your computer system. 
JavaScript is a language of commands that can be embedded directly in an
HTML file.  These commands are executed on your system when you access a web
page containing JavaScript.

<p>
&browser.name; can prevent Java applets and JavaScript commands from 
affecting your system in any way. You can grant applets and
JavaScript code more relaxed permissions, thus allowing them to do more 
interesting things but opening the door for <i>potentially</i> insecure 
actions such as reading or writing files.

<p>
Use the settings on the Security Preferences dialog box to set a default 
security level that will apply to JavaScript code and <i>unsigned</i> 
applets, and one that will apply to all <i>signed</i> applets.  You can 
also completely disable unsigned applets, JavaScript, or both.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name=signed></a>
<b>Signed versus Unsigned Applets</b>

<p>
Signed applets contain a digital <i>signature</i>, which is a sequence of 
characters embedded in the applet's code. It is placed there by the originator 
of the applet, and it can't be altered or duplicated. It tells who the applet 
comes from, and that the applet has not been tampered with. A signature 
doesn't tell you anything about the content or quality of the applet, 
just that it comes from a particular source. 

<!--
If an applet is signed with a name you recognize and trust, you can probably 
have confidence in it.
-->

<p>
The majority of applets currently on the World Wide Web are unsigned applets.
JavaScript code and unsigned applets are probably reliable, but you have 
no way to know their source. An unsigned applet could also have been tampered 
with in such a way that it does things its author didn't intend.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If your version of &browser.name; does not support SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer), signed applets are treated as unsigned applets.  That is,
signed applets take on the security level you assign for unsigned applets.  
This is because without SSL &browser.name; has no way to verify the 
certificates of signed applets. You can tell if your version of &browser.name;
supports SSL by setting the Security Administration Mode to Advanced.  If
the only Advanced Security Mode options presented to you are for Cookies
and Applets and JavaScript, your version does not support SSL. If your
Advanced Security Mode options also include Web Sites and Certificates, 
your version does support SSL, so signed and unsigned applets can be
given different security levels.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Setting Security Levels</b>
<p>
Use the <b>Applets and JavaScript</b> panel to set a security level for 
unsigned applets and JavaScript code.  You might want a more 
restrictive security level on unsigned applets and JavaScript, since you
can't always know their source.
<p>
Use the <b>Signed Applets</b> panel to set a separate security level for 
signed applets.  
<p>
Use the <a href="#special.cases">Special Cases</a>
panel to set a security level for applets and JavaScript from a particular
web site or applets signed with <a name="#certificates">certificates</a> from 
a particular source.

<p>
<a name=security.modes></a>
The security level settings are:
<ul>
<li><b>Blocked</b>: Blocked applets and JavaScript code are not permitted 
to run.  On the Applets and JavaScript panel, you can apply the Blocked
setting by deselecting the <b>Enable Applets</b> or <b>Enable JavaScript</b> 
options, or both. Deselecting the Enable Applets option blocks only 
<i>unsigned</i> applets from running.  (Use the Signed Applets panel to 
block signed applets.)
<p>

<li><b>Restricted</b>: Applets and JavaScript granted the Restricted Security 
level run with safe constraints and are blocked from unsafe actions. They 
can't read, write, or delete files.  They may connect to, and accept 
connections from, only the server of their origin. They cannot access the 
print queue or system clipboard. They can create new windows, but only 
windows that contain a warning banner that lets you know the source of 
the window.
<p>

<a name=ask.first></a>
<li><b>Ask First</b>: Applets and JavaScript granted the Ask First Security 
level run with safe constraints. In most cases, if they attempt any of the 
actions prevented under the Restricted Security level, above, &browser.name; 
will give you a warning, and you may then grant permission for that action if 
you want.
<p>
There are a few exceptions to this rule of thumb. Applets and JavaScript with 
the Ask First Security setting cannot exit &browser.name; or access the system 
clipboard or print queue, even with a warning.  
<p>

<a name=unprotected></a>
<li><b>Unprotected</b>: The unprotected option is only available 
on the Special Cases panel. The unprotected mode allows applets
and JavaScript to read, write, and delete files without warning, 
connect to another computer and accept network connections without 
warning, create windows without warning banners, and access the 
system clipboard and print queue.  Use this mode only when you trust 
the source of the applets and JavaScript.

</ul>
<p>

If you would like to see a side-by-side comparison of what each security level 
allows, see the <a href="security-table.html">Security Table</a>.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name="special.cases"></a>
<b>Special Cases</b>
<p>
Use Special Cases to override the global default security levels you 
set for JavaScript, signed applets, and unsigned applets.  

<p>
You can set a security mode for all signed applets with a particular 
<a name="#certificates">certificate</a>. 
You can also set a security level for all applets and JavaScript from 
a certain web site server, but you should use caution when doing this. In 
general, this is only recommended for a site inside a trusted firewall, 
because unsigned applets and JavaScript cannot be completely protected from 
tampering.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> You cannot set special permissions for a <i>particular</i> 
applet or script.  You can only set special permissions for <i>all</i> 
applets or scripts coming from a particular site, or all signed applets 
with a particular certificate.

<p>
There are various reasons that you might want to grant applets from a 
particular site or signed with a particular trusted certificate more 
permissive access to your system than the default. You might want to 
allow a downloaded word processor from a trusted site, for example, to 
save a file to your hard disk. Or you might want to allow applets that 
originate within your company firewall to have full access to your system. 

<p>
Use the <b>New</b> button to add special security permissions for 
a particular web site or certificate. The New Special Case dialog box
enables you to set the basis for the special case to be either:
<ul>
<li>Applets and JavaScript from a web site you specify, or 
<p>
<li>Applets signed with a software publisher certificate you choose from 
a menu. &browser.name; does not support signed JavaScript, so this option
is only available for signed applets.
<p>
The list of available certificates to choose from consists of certificates 
for all the signed applets you have previously run.  Therefore, to add a 
certificate to this list, run a signed applet that is signed with that 
certificate in &browser.name; (for example, by loading a page containing 
that signed applet).
</ul>

<p>
For each web site or certificate you specify, you can set any of the 
<a href="#security.modes">security modes</a> described above. 

<p>
<a name=web.sites></a>
<hr>
<h2>Web Sites (SSL Versions Only)</h2>

<b>Note:</b> The Web Sites options are only available in versions of 
&browser.name; that support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).  If these options 
don't appear on your Security Preferences dialog box in the list at the left 
side, your version of &browser.name; does not support these features.  

<a name=secure.web.sites></a>
<p>
Secure web sites start with <b>https://</b> (as opposed to
<b>http://</b>), and are available to you if your version of &browser.name;
supports SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).  
<p>
When you connect to a secure web site, information that passes between
your site and the https secure server may be encrypted while in transit.
Only your computer and the server can make sense of that information.  This
is important because it allows you to securely transfer private information,
such as credit card numbers and passwords.
<p>
In addition to encrypting information in transit, SSL support means that 
the https secure server can <i>authenticate</i> itself to &browser.name;. 
This means that no other computer can pretend to be the secure site, and 
thereby intercept information you send to that site.
<p>
<a name=lock></a>
When &browser.name; connects to a secure site, the icon at the left
of the status bar (typically at the bottom of the browser) appears
locked: <img src="doc:/lib/images/lockOn.gif">
<br>
Otherwise it appears unlocked: <img src="doc:/lib/images/lock.gif">

<p>
You can click the lock icon at any time to display information about where 
the current page comes from, whether it was encrypted before it was 
transferred, and if it was encrypted, what 
<a href="#ciphers">cipher</a> was used to encrypt the page.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name=warnings></a>
<b>Warnings</b>

<p>
In addition to the visual clue (the lock) that the page you're currently 
viewing allows secure transactions (or not), you can have &browser.name; 
display a warning, in the form of a pop-up confirmation notice, before either
or both of the following actions: 
<ul>
<li>Entering a secure site
<li>Leaving a secure site
</ul>
<p>
The default is to provide both warning messages.  
<p>
When entering a secure web site, the message displayed 
isn't really a warning as much as it is a notice. That is, there is really 
nothing to be worried about.  Even when leaving a secure site, think of the 
warning as a notification just to keep you alerted to the status of
pages you're viewing or sending data to.  You may decide to disable
the warning notices altogether, in order to access pages more quickly and
with fewer keystrokes.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name=ciphers></a>
<b>SSL Ciphers (Advanced Mode Only)</b>

<p>
When you access a secure web site, (a site whose address, or URL, starts with 
"https://"), information 
that passes to and from that web server is encrypted during transmission, so
there is no risk of having a third site intercept and read that information.
This is important, for example, when sending credit card numbers. 

<p>
Ciphers are algorithms that the are used to encrypt and decrypt this
information. Ciphers with higher numbers are generally more secure than
those with lower numbers.  

<p>
Use the SSL Ciphers scrolling list to tell &browser.name; which ciphers
you'll accept when accessing secure web sites.

<p>
<hr>
<a name="certificates"></a>
<h2>Certificates (Advanced Mode and SSL Versions Only)</h2>

<b>Note:</b> The Certificate options only appear on 
the Security Preferences
Page if you're using the Advanced Security Administration Mode.  Most of
this documentation therefore assumes you are using the Advanced Mode. 
However, if you are running in the Basic Security Mode, you may at times
be presented with dialog boxes asking about certificates used by a page you 
are trying to access.  Read this section if you'd like to learn more about 
certificates even if you are not using the Advanced Security Administration 
Mode.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The Certificates options are also only 
available in 
versions of &browser.name; that support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).  If these
options don't appear on your Security Preferences dialog box in the list at the 
left side, your version of &browser.name; does not support these features.  
<p>

Certificates are digital documents (also known as digital IDs) that are 
used to attest to someone's identity over a network, much like a driver's 
license is used to attest to the identity of someone who can legally drive.  
<p>
Certificates are issued by Certifying Authorities (also known as Certificate 
Authorities, or simply authorities). These are trusted third parties, such as
Verisign, Inc., that verify identities and issue certificates.  
<p>
There are three basic types of certificates that &browser.name; tracks: 
certifying authority certificates, web site certificates, and software 
publisher certificates.  

<a name=ca.certs></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>Certifying Authority Certificates</b></dt>
<dd>The Certifying Authority Certificates listed on the Security 
Preferences dialog box are certificates issued by Certificate Authorities
that &browser.name; recognizes and trusts.  &browser.name; is shipped with 
a set of trusted Certifying Authority Certificates, which you can view or 
remove.  If you have other certificates from Certifying Authorities you
trust, you can also import those certificates.  Whenever you access a 
secure web site or page with a Java applet whose certificate 
was issued from one of the trusted Certifying Authorities on this list,
you can view that page without notifications.

<a name=website.certs></a>
<p>
<dt><b>Web Site Certificates</b></dt>
<dd>When you access a <a href="#secure.web.sites">secure web 
site</a>, (a site whose address, or URL, starts with "https://"), the server 
where the web 
site resides uses a certificate to encrypt and authenticate the connection.
When you connect to a secure site, that site must present its certificate 
as part of the encryption process.
<p>
If &browser.name; doesn't recognize the certificate or the certifying
authority that issued the certificate, a dialog box gives 
you the option to connect to the site anyway just for this session, 
to connect and add the new certificate to the list of Web Site Certificates
that &browser.name; always trusts, or not to connect.  If you're running in
Basic Security Administration Mode, you'll be given the option to connect
for this session only, or not to connect.

<a name=software.certs></a>
<p>
<dt><b>Software Publisher Certificates</b></dt>
<dd>
When you access a page containing a signed Java applet, the signed applet 
is accompanied by a certificate that identifies the applet signer and 
prevents others from tampering with the applet. 

<p>
If you access a page with a signed applet whose certificate (or the certifying
authority of the certificate) is not recognized, a dialog box gives you the 
option to accept the certificate for this session only, to add the certificate 
to the list of trusted Software Publisher Certificates, or not to run the 
applet at all.  In Basic Security mode, you'll only have the option to trust 
the certificate for this session, or not to connect.
</dl>

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Verifying Certificates</b>
<p>
When you encounter a new certificate from an unknown source, you should 
verify that the certificate is valid. The certificates that
are shipped with &browser.name; have already been verified.

<a name=view.cert></a>
<p>
When you encounter a new certificate, the dialog box that asks if
you want to trust the new certificate contains a View Certificate button.
In addition, each list of known certificates on the Security Preferences
Certificates panels contains a View Certificate button.

<a name=verify.cert></a>
<p>
To verify a certificate, click the View Certificate button to see more
information about the selected or recently encountered certificate. 
The certificate's <b>Fingerprint</b> is a mathematical representation 
of the certificate that is difficult to forge. If you confirm that the 
sequence of numbers in the Fingerprint field matches the fingerprint given 
to you from the certificate owner, you can be confident that the certificate 
is valid. You need to contact the owner of the certificate (or the
authority that issued the certificate) to verify the
fingerprint. For maximum security, this confirmation should not happen
using the Internet. Use the telephone, a fax machine, or regular mail.
