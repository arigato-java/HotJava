<dl>
<dt><a name=file_menu></a><b>File Menu</b>
<dd>
<dl>

<dt><b><a name="NewWindow">New Window</a></b>
<dd>Starts a new &browser.name; window displaying your home page.  
<p>
If the New Window menu item is disabled, &browser.name; is running 
low on <a href="trouble.html#memory">memory</a>. 

<p>
<dt><a name=goto_place></a><b>Open</b>
<dd>Choose Open to display a dialog box in which you can type the
<a href="exploring.html#urls">Address</a> of a new page to visit, or choose
a file on your local system to open. This Address field is equivalent to the 
Address field that is normally found in the header or footer of &browser.name;.  
Use this dialog box if you have disabled the default Address field by choosing 
"None" for the <a href="display_prefs.html#Locator">Address option</a> 
in the Screen Layout section of the General Preferences Display page.
<p>
Use the <a name="OpenFile">File</a> button in the Open dialog box
to open a document on your local system.  The File button displays another 
dialog box from which you can select a document to open. This is the 
standard file chooser for your system. 
<p>
If the Open menu item is disabled, &browser.name; is running 
low on <a href="trouble.html#memory">memory</a>. 

<p>
<dt><b><a name="SaveFile">Save As</a></b>
<dd>Displays the Save Document dialog box so you can specify a location in which
to save the currently displayed <a href="exploring.html#HTML">HTML</a> 
document. The saved file includes the HTML format tags, so it does not 
look exactly the same as what you see displayed in the browser. This dialog 
box is the standard file chooser for your platform.

<a name="SaveLink"></a>
<p>
You can also save a link or an image by pressing the right mouse button 
over the desired link or image, then choosing <b>Save this Link</b> or 
<b>Save this Image</b> from the <nobr><wbr>pop-up</nobr> menu. 

<p>
<dt><a name=frame.save></a><b>Save Frame As</a></b> 
<dd>If the current page contains multiple frames (which look like rectangular
boxed areas), Save Frame As displays a dialog box in which you can specify a 
file in which to save the currently selected frame's 
<a href="exploring.html#HTML">HTML</a> source. 
This works like the Save As menu item described above, except that it saves
a specific frame.  If the current page contains frames, the Save As menu item
saves the HTML page containing the <i>frameset</i> that defines the grouping
of frames on the page, instead of the currently selected frame.
<p>
To select a different frame, click anywhere within that frame.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=print>Print</a></b> 
<dd>Displays the Print dialog box, which varies depending on your platform.
<p>
The size and style of the printed text depend on the Printer Font
and Printer Font Size settings, set on the 
<a href="text_prefs.html">Text Preferences</a> page.
<p>
Please note that if the page cannot be printed using the specified 
printer font size without clipping wide text, such as tables or preformatted 
HTML text (for example, code samples), the print type size will be scaled down 
so that all the text fits on the printed page. If the scaling is too small, you 
might want to try printing in <i>Landscape mode</i>, where pages are printed 
with the long edges of the paper at the top and bottom. More text can fit on 
each line, so the scaling down of type size is less likely to be necessary. 
<p>
The standard Print dialog box for your system enables you to specify 
some combination of the following items, but probably not all of them:

<ul>
<li>Name of the printer to print to and, on some platforms, properties 
associated with that particular printer.
<p>
<li>Orientation, to specify Portrait printing (where the long side of
the paper is vertical, like most books), or Landscape printing (the long 
side of the paper is horizontal).
<p>
<li>Title for your Print Job or Banner Page (the cover sheet).
<p>
<li>Page Description Type, such as PostScript or PCL (Printer Control 
Language).  This information specifies what format of printed output your
printer understands.  In most cases, you should use the default format
specified, which is usually PostScript.  If you're not sure what your
printer requires, either try different options or talk to your System 
Administrator.
<p>
<li>Paper Size. Common paper size options are Letter (8.5 x 11 in.), 
Legal (8.5 x 14 in.), A4 (210 x 297 mm.), or Executive (7.25 x 10.25 in.).
<p>
<li>Input Slot, which specifies how paper is fed to your printer.  Most 
of the time, the paper is loaded from a cassette of paper, but there may 
be instances when you want or need to load paper manually, one sheet at 
a time.
<p>
<li>Number of copies to print.
<p>
<li>An option to print to a file instead of a printer.  In this case, you 
will be asked for the name of a file to be created.
<p>
<li>Any desired print command options used with your standard print command. 
For example, on Solaris<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> systems, you can 
specify "no banner page" by typing 
<kbd>-o nobanner</kbd> in the Print Command Options field.  This generates the 
Solaris print command <kbd>lp -o nobanner</kbd>.
<p>
<li>The print range, which is always the entire current web page.  No matter 
how large a web page is, it's considered to be one page. Therefore the entire 
web page is printed, even if it results in many physical pages.
<p>
<li>An option to collate multiple copies.
</ul>
The Print menu item is equivalent to the Print 
button <img src="doc:/lib/images/print.gif">.

<p>
<dt><a name=frame.print></a><b>Print Frame</a></b> 
<dd>If the current page contains multiple frames (which look like rectangular
boxed areas), Print Frame prints the currently selected frame.
This works like the Print menu item described above, except that it prints
only a specific frame.  If the current page contains frames, the Print menu 
item described above prints every frame on the page.
<p>
To select a different frame, click anywhere within that frame.  You can then
use the Print Frame menu item to print just that part of the page.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=send.mail>Send Mail</a></b>
<dd>Displays a form you can use to send email, optionally including the 
web site address or <a href="exploring.html#HTML">HTML</a> source for the current page. 
<p>
Type the destination email address in the <b>To</b> field, and type
your message in the large <b>Message</b> area. To send your mail to 
multiple people, separate the email addresses with spaces or commas.
<p>
<a name="MailIncludeURL"></a>
Click the <b>Include Web Site Address</b> button to add the web page
address (also known as the URL) of the current page to the Message area.  This 
is a convenient way to tell somebody about a web page you found.
<p>
<a name="MailAttachHTML"></a>
Select <b>Attach HTML</b> to add the HTML source of the current page as
an attachment to your message. You won't actually see the HTML source in
the Send Mail form, but the receiver will see it as an attachment when the 
message is sent.
<p>
Click the <b>Send</b> button to send the message. 

<p>
<dt><b><a name="CloseWindow">Close Window</a></b>
<dd>Closes the current &browser.name; window. If there are multiple &browser.name; 
windows open, only the current window is closed. If this is the only 
&browser.name; window, Close quits &browser.name; application.

<p>
<dt><b><a name="ExitBrowser">Exit</a></b>
<dd>Exits &browser.name;, quitting all &browser.name; windows started 
in the current session.
</dl>	
</dl>	

<dl>
<dt><a name=edit_menu></a><b>Edit Menu</b>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><b><a name=EditCopy>Copy</a></b>
<dd>Copies selected text from the currently displayed document to the system 
clipboard. This menu item is only active when text is selected on a page 
displayed by &browser.name;.  You cannot use this menu item to select 
text from an applet or a browser field, including the Address field.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=EditPaste>Paste</a></b>
<dd>Pastes text from the system clipboard into the 
Address field.  If text is currently selected in the Address field, the pasted
text will overwrite the selected text.  Otherwise, the text will be pasted at
the location of the cursor.
<p>
You can copy text to the system clipboard using the Copy key on your keyboard,
or the <nobr><wbr>Edit->Copy</nobr> menu item.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=find>Find in Page</a></b>
<dd>Displays the Find window, in which you
type the text you want to search for in the current page. If the
text is found, it is highlighted, and the page scrolls if necessary to display
the highlighted text. 
<p>
If the current page contains multiple frames, the search will take place in
the currently selected frame.  The currently selected frame is identified 
by a thin black border.  To select a different frame, click anywhere inside
that frame.
<p>
By default, the search operation is not case sensitive, which means 
&browser.name; 
does not distinguish between upper- or lowercase text while 
searching. For example, a request to find the word <em>Java</em> will 
find <em>java</em>, <em>JAVA</em>, <em>jAvA</em>, or any other 
combination of upper- and lowercase letters. 
<p>
You can also choose to do a case-sensitive search, which means &browser.name;
does distinguish between upper- and lowercase text, and only
finds text that matches exactly.  Thus a case-sensitive request
to find <em>Java</em> will only find the string <em>Java</em>; 
it will not find <em>java</em>, <em>JAVA</em>, and so on.
<p>
Use the Find button in the Find window to initiate each search.
The search begins either from the currently highlighted text or from the
top of the current page (or frame) if no text is highlighted.
<p>
Use the Clear button to quickly empty the Find field.  
<br>
Use the Close button to dismiss the Find window.

<p>
<dt><a name=search></a><b>Search the Internet</b>
<dd>Search the Internet takes you to a search page, where you can use one or
more search engines to find web pages on any topic.

<p>
<dt><a name=prefs></a><b>Preference Pages</b>
<dd>Use the Preferences options to display the various Preference pages.
<p>
Each Preferences page has OK, Apply, Cancel, and Help buttons at the bottom.  
The default button (typically the OK button) is bordered by a black line.  
If you press Enter or Return, the default button action is performed.
<p>
Click <b>OK</b> to activate any changes you've made 
and dismiss the Preferences page.
<p>
Click <b>Apply</b> to activate any changes you've made but leave the 
Preferences page displayed.
<p>
Click <b>Cancel</b> to cancel any setting changes you haven't yet applied 
and close the window.
<p>
Click <b>Help</b> to see the documentation about that
particular page. 
<p>
Follow these links for information about the Preference pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="display_prefs.html">General Preferences, Display</a>
<li><a href="text_prefs.html">General Preferences, Text</a>
<li><a href="clock_prefs.html">General Preferences, Clock</a>
<li><a href="mail_prefs.html">General Preferences, Mail</a>
<li><a href="proxies.html">General Preferences, Proxies</a>
<li><a href="security.html">Security Preferences</a>
</ul>
<p>
On platforms that support launching external applications, you will also see 
a <a href="viewer_apps.html">Content Viewer Preferences</a> page.
This is not available on JavaStation<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font>
platforms.

</dl>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name=view_menu></a><b>View Menu</b><dd> 
<dl>
<dt><b><a name=reload></a>Reload Page</b>
<dd>Reloads the current page. This is useful if changes have been made
to the current <a href="exploring.html#HTML">HTML</a> source, if a page 
doesn't load correctly the first time, or to restart an applet that 
stopped running during a low memory condition. 
<br>
Reload Page is equivalent to the Reload Page 
button <img src="doc:/lib/images/reload.gif">.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=background.images>Display Background Images</a></b>
<dd>This option is selected by default. Disable this option
if you don't want to display the backgrounds of pages.  This can 
increase the speed of loading a page and, in some cases, make pages easier 
to read. 
<p>
If you normally display background images but want to turn the background 
image off for the current page, deselect the Display Background Images 
check box.  When you're done viewing the page, you may want to choose
Display Background Images again to turn background images back on for other
pages.
<p>
The Display Background Images option applies only to backgrounds made up of
an image, or a tiled (repeated) image.  Display Background Images
has no affect on backgrounds that are a solid color.

<p>
<dt><a name=stop><b>Stop Loading</b></a>
<dd>Stops all loading of the current page. This menu item is available only
while a page is being loaded. Only the <em>loading</em> of a page is stopped;
if an applet has been loaded and is running, this will not stop the applet.
If &browser.name; is making a connection when you choose Stop Loading, 
&browser.name; still completes the connection attempt.
<br>
Stop Loading is equivalent to the Stop Loading 
button <img src="doc:/lib/images/stop.gif">.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=character.sets>Character Encoding</a></b>
<dd>
&browser.name; supports the Unicode 2.0 character encoding, and can display
both Latin and non-Latin Unicode characters from regions all over the globe.
<p>
To view HTML pages that use an alternate character encoding, choose that 
encoding from the Character Encoding submenus. Only one alternate character 
encoding can be specified at any one time.  The current character 
encoding is shown in the submenus with a selected check box.
<p>
If the http server sends information with a page telling &browser.name;
what character encoding the page uses, &browser.name; will automatically 
display that page with that character encoding.
<p>
<a name="AutoDetect"></a>
If you choose Auto Detect in the Japanese character encoding submenu, 
&browser.name; tries to analyze the page to determine which Japanese character 
encoding to use.  
<p>
To successfully view a page containing an alternate character encoding, you 
must have the appropriate system fonts available on your system. Contact your 
system administrator for help.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=ignore.charset>Ignore Charset Directive</a></b>
<dd>Sometimes the author of an HTML page, or the server that sends the page,
uses a meta tag to direct the browser to use a particular character encoding. 
In this case, the browser is expected always to use that character encoding, 
regardless of the <a href="#character.sets">Character Encoding</a> option you 
have chosen.  In the unusual case that the "directed" character encoding is 
incorrect, &browser.name; cannot correctly render the page. You will 
be prompted to try to ignore the character set directive, and then 
try to display the page using the default (or some other) character encoding.
<p>
To ignore the character set specified by the page author or server, select
Ignore Charset Directive. This option should normally be selected <i>only</i> 
when you encounter a page that specifies an incorrect character encoding. 

<p>
<dt><a name=html.source></a><b>Page Source</b> 
<dd>Opens a window in which the current page's 
<a href="exploring.html#HTML">HTML</a> source file is displayed. 
<p> 
You can save the HTML text to a file using the <nobr><wbr>File->Save As</nobr>
menu item.

<p>
<dt><a name=frame.source></a><b>Frame Source</b> 
<dd>If the current page contains multiple frames (which look like rectangular
boxed areas), Frame Source opens a page in which the currently selected frame's 
<a href="exploring.html#HTML">HTML</a> source file is displayed. 
To select a different frame, click anywhere within that frame.
<p>
If the current page contains frames, the Page Source option displays the
page containing the <i>frameset</i> that defines the grouping of frames on 
the page.  Use Frame Source to display the source for the individual frames.
<p>
If the current page does not contain frames, the Frame Source menu item 
is disabled.

<p>
<dt><b><a name="Console">Show Console</a></b>
<dd>Display the Java<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> Console to see output and 
error messages from Java applets and JavaScript<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 
commands running in &browser.name;, as well as messages output by 
&browser.name; itself.
</dl>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name=go_menu></a><b>Go Menu</b>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><a name=back></a><b>Back</b>
<dd>Back takes you back to the previous place you visited. If you choose Back 
again, it takes you to the place you visited the time before that, and so on. 
You can also access the Back menu item by pressing the right mouse button when 
the pointer is in the &browser.name; display window.
<br>
Back is equivalent to the Back button <img src="doc:/lib/images/back.gif">.

<p>
<dt><a name=forward></a><b>Forward</b>
<dd>Forward displays the page viewed prior to choosing Back (or prior to 
clicking the Back button). Forward only works after Back has been used.
You can also access the Forward menu item by pressing the right mouse 
button with the pointer in the &browser.name; display window.
<br>
Forward is equivalent to the Forward button <img src="doc:/lib/images/fwd.gif">.

<p>
<dt><a name=home></a><b>Home</b>
<dd>Loads the home page you selected using the 
Home Page Address option on the 
<a href="display_prefs.html">Display Preferences</a> page. If you 
haven't specified a home page, the default home page is loaded. 
The default home page is either Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s home page, 
or a home page set up by your system administrator.
<br>
This is equivalent to the Home button <img src="doc:/lib/images/home.gif">.
(If the Home Page Address field on the Display Preferences page is blank,
the Home button will be disabled.)

<p>
<dt><b><a name=history></a>Show History</b>
<dd>Every time you visit a page, its address (or URL) is automatically appended 
to the bottom of the <b>History</b> list for the current browser window. 
When you choose the Show History item, a page is displayed that consists 
of links to all the items on that History list.
<p>
Each browser window that you have open maintains a separate History list.
Visiting a page in one &browser.name; window does not add that page to a 
different &browser.name; window's History list.
<p>
When you close a &browser.name; window, its History list is deleted. (This
only happens when the window is closed, not when it's minimized or iconified.)
When you open a new &browser.name; window, a fresh History list for that
window is started.
All History lists are restarted with each new &browser.name; session. 
You cannot delete an address from a History list, or edit it in any way. 

</dl>
</dl>


<dl>
<dt><a name=bookmarks_menu></a><b>Bookmarks Menu</b>
<dd>
Use the items on the Bookmarks menu to mark and revisit pages. 
<p>
This section contains a fair amount of detailed information about &browser.name;
bookmarks.  To skip past the details and get
straight to information about a particular menu item, use these links:
<ul>
<li><a href="#edit.bookmarks">Edit Bookmarks</a>
<li><a href="#add.bookmark">Add Bookmark</a>
<li><a href="#file.bookmark">File Bookmark</a>
<li><a href="#go.to.bookmark">Go to Bookmark</a>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to these four standard menu items, you may display bookmarks from
your <a href="#PersonalBookmarks">Personal Bookmarks list</a> at the bottom of the 
Bookmarks menu.

<p>
A bookmark is simply a placeholder for the address of a previously visited web 
page.
<p>
<a name="BookmarkLists"></a>
Bookmarks in &browser.name; are organized into <i>Bookmark Lists</i>.
To organize these lists, choose Edit Bookmarks from the Bookmarks menu. 
This displays the Bookmarks window. You may want to display this window 
for reference while reading this section.

<p>
&browser.name; initially provides you with two or three Bookmark Lists, 
as described below.  The Personal Bookmarks and Cool Bookmarks lists can't be
deleted, but you can add more lists of your own.  

<p>
The default Bookmark Lists are:

<ul>
<li><b><a name="PersonalBookmarks">Personal Bookmarks</a></b>
<br>The Personal Bookmarks list contains the pages added whenever you choose Add 
Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu.  

<p>
You can keep the new bookmarks you add on this list, or you can move them to 
other lists.
See <a href="#edit.bookmarks">Edit Bookmarks</a> for information about managing
your Personal Bookmarks and other lists.  

<p>
By default, all bookmarks in your Personal Bookmarks list are also displayed at 
the bottom of your Bookmarks menu (after the Go to Bookmarks item) for easy access.
Just choose the bookmark in the Bookmarks menu to display that page.
If you prefer, you can keep your Personal Bookmarks off the main Bookmarks 
menu using the Show Personal Bookmarks in Bookmarks Menu option on the 
<a href="display_prefs.html#show_bookmarks">Display Preferences</a> page.

<p>
<li><b><a name="CoolBookmarks">Cool Bookmarks</a></b>
<br>Cool Bookmarks initially contains a list of useful bookmarks, including 
several pages commonly used to search the World Wide Web. Add or remove items 
from this list to make it reflect your personal idea of Cool Bookmarks.

<p>
<li><b><a name="NetscapeBookmarks">Netscape<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 
Bookmarks List</a></b>
<br>This list is created each time you run &browser.name; if it 
finds a list of bookmarks created by Netscape Navigator<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font>. 
<p>
Because this page automatically gets updated with your latest set of Netscape 
bookmarks every time you run &browser.name;, you cannot modify this list 
(for example, add or delete items) from within &browser.name;.  
</ul>

<p>
The Bookmarks menu provides the following functions:

<dl>
<dt><b><a name=edit.bookmarks>Edit Bookmarks</a></b>
<dd>This displays the <b>Bookmarks window</b>, which you use to
organize and revisit bookmarks on your Bookmark Lists. 
<p>
Lists (indicated by <img src="doc:/lib/images/list.icon.gif">) are displayed 
in the top part of the window; the contents of the
currently selected list are displayed in the bottom. 
<p>
Each list consists of bookmarks (links to pages) and folders. Each folder 
can contain more folders, bookmarks, or both. You can think of a list as a 
top-level folder.  
<p>
<a name=OpenFolder></a>
Double-click a closed folder (indicated by 
<img src="doc:/lib/images/folder.icon.gif">)
to open it. You can only see and access items in a folder when it is open. 
The contents of an open folder are displayed in a list beneath that folder.
<p>
Double-click an open folder (indicated by 
<img src="doc:/lib/images/openfldr.icon.gif">)
to close it in order to preserve space in your list.   
<p>
<a name="VisitURL"></a>
<b>To visit a page</b>, double-click the bookmark. Bookmarks are indicated 
by lines of plain text in the bottom half of the Bookmarks window.
<p>
Hold down the Shift key while double-clicking the bookmark to open the page
in a new &browser.name; window.

<p>
<a name="DisplayURL"></a>
<b>To see the address of a bookmark</b>, click the bookmark to select it. 
The address of the bookmark is displayed in the message area at the bottom of the
Bookmarks window.
<p>

<a name="AddBookmark"></a>
<b>To add a new bookmark to a list:</b>
<ol>
<li>Display the page in &browser.name;.
<p>
<li>Choose Add Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu.
<br>This adds the current page to the end of the Personal Bookmarks list. 
<p>
Alternatively, use the File Bookmark submenu to add a new page directly to 
a list of your choice.
</ol>
<p>
Or:
<ol>
<li>Choose Edit Bookmarks from the Bookmarks menu.
<br>This displays the Bookmarks window.
<p><li>Select the list in the Bookmarks window where you want to add the 
new page.
<p><li>Choose New Bookmark from the Bookmarks window File menu.
<br>This displays the Add New Bookmark window.
<p><li>Type the address and title for the new page, then click the OK button.
</ol>

<p>
<a name="DeleteBookmark"></a>
<b>To delete a bookmark, list, or folder:</b>
<ol>
<li>If the Bookmarks window is not currently displayed, choose
<nobr><wbr>Bookmarks->Edit Bookmarks</nobr> to display it.
<p><li>Select the bookmark, list, or folder you want to delete. If the 
bookmark or folder you want to delete is not displayed, select the list
in which it appears to display the contents of that list.
<p><li>Choose <nobr><wbr>Edit->Delete</nobr> in the Bookmarks window.
<p>
If you make a mistake or change your mind after you delete the item,
choose <nobr><wbr>Edit->Undo</nobr>. 
</ol>

<p>
<a name="MoveBookmark"></a>
<b>To move a bookmark or folder to a new location:</b>
<ol>
<li>If the Bookmarks window is not currently displayed, choose
<nobr><wbr>Bookmarks->Edit Bookmarks</nobr> to display it.
<p><li>If the item you want to move is not in the currently selected list,
select the list containing the item. 
<p><li>Select the item in the list that you want to move.
<p><li>Drag the item to its new location. 
This can be another location within the same list, or it can be 
another list. If you drop the bookmark on another list or folder, it is 
added at the top of that list or folder.
</ol>
<p>
<b>To move a bookmark or folder to a new location using 
Cut, Copy, and Paste:</b>
<ol>
<li>Select the bookmark or folder you want to move.
<p>
<li>Choose <nobr><wbr>Edit->Cut</nobr> in the Bookmarks window if 
you want to move the item; choose <nobr><wbr>Edit->Copy</nobr> if you'd 
prefer to leave a copy of the item in its original location. 
<p>
<li>Select the new list or folder in which you want to put the item being moved.
<p>
<li>Choose <nobr><wbr>Edit->Paste</nobr> in the Bookmarks window. 
<p>
The cut or copied item is added to the selected list or folder.
The Paste menu item is only available after you have done a Cut or Copy.
