<dt><b><a name="access">Why can't I access web sites outside my company 
network?</a></b>
<dd>
Your company network firewall could be preventing you from making connections, 
especially if you haven't configured your proxy servers.
Choose General Preferences from the Edit menu, then select Proxies from the
list on the left side of the General Preferences dialog box.  Contact
your system administrator for the proxy information specific to your site.
<p>
Do not fill out the SOCKS fields on the Proxies panel if you do not have a 
SOCKS server, or &browser.name; won't be able to connect outside your firewall.
<p>
For more information, see <a href="proxies.html">&browser.name; Proxies</a>.
<p>

<dt><b><a name="website">Why do http and ftp requests to certain web sites
sometimes fail?</a></b>
<dd>
Due to heavy demand at very popular web sites, a server
may be overloaded and can turn away requests. If you run into this problem, 
try accessing the site again later.
<p>

<dt><b><a name="gray">Why are some menu entries in &browser.name; dimmed 
(and unusable)?</a></b>
<dd>
Dimmed menu items indicate that the menu item is not available 
because of the current state of the browser. For example, the Stop Loading
menu item is not available when nothing is currently being loaded. Also,
if your system is running very low on memory, some items may be disabled
temporarily.
<p>

<dt><b><a name="launch">When I download a file of a certain type, &browser.name; 
displays a page that says "Unable to Launch Viewer."  What can I 
do?</a></b>
<dd>
On network computers, such as the JavaStation<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 
platform, you may not have the capability to launch external applications.
<p>
On other platforms, such as the Solaris<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 
platform, a frequent cause of this 
problem is not setting the exec.path property in your personal properties 
file.  The exec.path property is a list of full directory names on your 
machine where &browser.name; should look for executable external viewer 
applications.  
<p>
See <a href="viewer_execpath.html">Setting the exec.path Property</a> for information.
<p>

<dt><b><a name="long.lines">I'm viewing an HTML page that has very long lines 
that are cut off before the end of the line. What's happening?</a></b>
<dd>
The text of most HTML pages automatically reformats itself to fit the size of
your &browser.name; window. However, HTML text that appears under the 
&lt;PRE&gt; tag (meaning "preformatted") is not reformatted to fit the width 
of the browser. You can almost always scroll horizontally to see an entire 
line of preformatted text if it extends off the page. However, if a line of 
preformatted text exceeds 1024 characters, the line is truncated. 
&browser.name; sets the maximum possible number of displayed characters at 
1024 characters.
<p>

<dt><b><a name="cdrive">When I type a web site address (or <i>URL</i>) that 
starts with "c:" on a Windows platform, I get an 
error message. Why doesn't &browser.name; recognize this as drive C?</a></b>
<dd>
When a <a href="exploring.html#urls">URL</a> starts with a simple text 
string before a colon, the string is considered to be an Internet Transfer 
Protocol. This is the standard syntax for URLs. 
<p>
To access a file on your C drive, start your URL with the
string <nobr><wbr><tt>/c<b>:</b>/<i>yourfile</i></tt></nobr> or 
<nobr><wbr><tt>file<b>:</b>/c<b>:</b>/<i>yourfile</i></tt>.</nobr> 
If you want to list the contents of the C drive, use the URL
<nobr><wbr><tt>/c<b>:</b>/<b>.</b></tt></nobr> or 
<nobr><wbr><tt>file<b>:</b>/c<b>:</b>/<b>.</b></tt>.</nobr>
Starting a URL with "/" or "file<b>:</b>/" indicates that you want to use 
the file protocol to access your C drive. 
<p>

<dt><b><a name=ftp.protocol>Why does &browser.name; map the URL 
"file://filename" to an ftp protocol?</a></b>
<dd>
URL conventions specify that whatever follows two slashes (//) is 
an Internet host computer, or a <i>Web server</i>, that makes files 
available to the World Wide Web. The file protocol only 
understands local files, not remote servers, so browsers routinely 
map such a URL to an ftp protocol. Therefore, a URL of the form 
"file://filename" is interpreted as "ftp://filename/". 
<p>

<dt><b><a name="firewall">&browser.name; lets me use an IP address in a 
URL within my firewall, but not in a URL outside the firewall. Why?</a></b> 
<dd>
This is a known problem with some proxies, not a bug in &browser.name;. Try
using a different proxy server.
<p>

<dt><b><a name=ISINDEX>I'm looking at a page that tells me to use my 
browser's search function to enter search terms.  What does this mean?</a></b>
<dd>You'll see this message when the current HTML document is a 
<em>searchable index</em> (that is, when it includes the ISINDEX HTML tag 
in the document head). 
Below this message you should see a text field with a label telling you
to enter your search keywords. This is what the page is referring to as
"your browser's search function."
<p>
Use this text field to request a keyword search. Type the keyword you 
wish to search for, or a space-separated list of keywords, and press Return 
or Enter. &browser.name; then passes this search information to the 
document's server, which performs the search.
<p>
The difference between <nobr><wbr>Edit->Find in Page</nobr> searches 
and ISINDEX searches is that Find in Page signals &browser.name; 
to search the currently displayed page, while ISINDEX searches ask the 
current document's server to search a database that the server maintains. 
What is returned by an ISINDEX search depends on how the server displays 
the results.

<p>
<dt><b><a name=memory>Some of &browser.name;'s features quit working or
were disabled.  What happened?</a></b>
<dd>
If you're running &browser.name; on a system with low memory constraints,
&browser.name; may be running out of memory.
<p>
When &browser.name; gets close to reaching its memory limit, it
becomes aggressive in its attempts to free up memory. 
The actions that &browser.name; takes to free up memory in extreme 
conditions may include the following:
<ul>
<li>All applet and image loading is automatically delayed until a sufficient
amount of memory is once again available. See 
<a href="display_prefs.html#delay.applets">Automatically Load Java
Applets</a> and <a href="display_prefs.html#delay.images">Automatically  
Load Images</a> for more information.
<p>
<li>The Address field is disabled until there is sufficient memory to
display a new, potentially memory-intensive page. Similarly, the New Window, 
Open, and Edit Bookmarks menu items are also temporarily disabled.
The toolbar buttons and Bookmarks menu list are kept active. If you can
use these to move to a smaller page, you should do so.
<p>
<li>&browser.name; attempts to close any other &browser.name; windows you may 
have open, after asking you for permission to close each one.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The user-visible actions to clear memory are only likely to
happen on systems with very low memory resources.
