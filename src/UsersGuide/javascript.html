<p>

&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix; 
&release.version; allows you to browse HTML pages containing 
JavaScript<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> code.  
The JavaScript language adds dynamic and interactive capabilities to these 
pages, which may interact with forms, buttons, applets, or active images.
&browser.name; &release.version; aims to be compatible with the 
Netscape<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 3.0 object model 
and the ECMAScript 1.4 language specification.

<p>
The various browsers on the market today were designed to meet different 
specifications. Therefore, the designers of the HTML pages you want to 
view have had to write pages that work in all the common browsers, despite 
the fact that those browsers sometimes treat the same code differently, 
or look for different code to produce a similar result.  
In turn, a product like &browser.name; must be able to display varied HTML 
pages without crashing or freezing, whether the scripts in them are 
well-behaved or not.  This environment has required &browser.name; 
design team to make some choices that enable it to display pages without 
surprising results, and without compromising the security of the data 
on your system or network.

<p>
&browser.name; may refuse to allow an HTML page you're viewing to 
perform the changes it wants to make in your browser; some pages containing 
JavaScript may not load or function correctly.  &browser.name; will not 
allow security violations, such as trying to read the directories on your hard 
disk, or creating a secret window off the edge of your screen from which to 
spy on your other windows. 

<p>
&browser.name; will correctly interpret most 
pages containing JavaScript. When it encounters script it was not designed 
to handle, it will ignore that script and go on to render the rest of the 
page correctly.

<p>
If you need detailed technical information on how the &browser.name; 
JavaScript support differs from Netscape's support, see the JavaScript 
Exceptions document shipped with the &browser.name; administrator's 
documentation set.  This is normally found in the admin-docs subdirectory 
where the browser is installed.
