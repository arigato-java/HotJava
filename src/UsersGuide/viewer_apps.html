<p>

<a name="ViewerAppsPrefs"></a>
<b>Note:</b> The Content Viewers feature is not available on all platforms.
If the <nobr><wbr>Edit->Content</nobr> Viewer Preferences option is 
missing, (for example, if you are running 
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix; on the 
JavaStation<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> platform), the information on
this page does not apply to your browser.
<p>
There are a multitude of file types on the World Wide Web. When 
&browser.name; encounters a file that it can't display in a web page, it 
looks in a table of <i>Content Types</i> to find out how to display the
file based on its type. For example, when it encounters an audio file, it 
launches the appropriate audio player.
<p>
The information you set on the Content Viewer Preferences page tells 
&browser.name; to do one of the following things when it encounters a file of
a specific type:
<ul>
<li>Display the file within &browser.name
<li>Launch an external application to display the file
<li>Save the file to your local system
<li>Display a page to ask you what to do with the file
</ul>

<p>
<a name="MimeType"></a>
&browser.name; determines the type of a file by referencing its 
<b>MIME</b> (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) type, which is sent to the 
browser from the http server along with the file. This tells &browser.name; the 
general type of file (text, audio, image, video, application, message, or 
multipart), and a more specific subtype (PostScript, TIFF, ZIP compressed data, 
and so on). 
<p>
If a file's MIME type is not available (for example, if the file is loaded
with a non-http protocol, such as the ftp or file protocol), 
&browser.name; uses the file's <b>extension</b> to map the file to a MIME type. The
file extension is simply the last letters of the file name, which appear 
after a period. For example, a file named "myfile.txt" has ".txt" as its
file extension, and maps to the text/plain MIME type.
<p>
<a name=action></a>
&browser.name; uses a table of content-type definitions, found on the 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->Content</nobr> Viewer Preferences page, to map content types 
(determined by MIME type or file extension) to applications. 
The <b>Action</b> listed for each content type tells &browser.name; to 
do one of the following to display a file of that type: 
<ol>
<li><a name="DisplayinHJB">Display the file within &browser.name;</a> 
(typically HTML, ASCII text, GIF images, and JPEG files). If &browser.name; doesn't 
have a content handler to display this type of file, it tries to display the 
file verbatim, that is, without special handling. 
<p>
<li><a name="LaunchApp">Launch an external application</a> to display the file (see the Note below).
<p>
<li><a name="SaveFile">Save the file</a> to your local system.
<p>
<li><a name="Ask">Display a page to ask you</a> what to do with the file.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> You <em>must</em> tell &browser.name; where on your system to find
your external applications by setting the <b>exec.path</b> property 
in your &browser.name; properties file. See 
<a href="viewer_execpath.html">Setting the exec.path Property</a> for information. 

<p>
<a name=file.types></a>
To see how &browser.name; currently handles files of a particular type, select the
type from the <b>Content Types</b> scrolling list. You can modify the following
information for that content type by updating the fields to the right of the
Content Types scrolling list, and clicking OK:

<ul>
<li><b>Description</b> is what will appear in the Content Types scrolling list when 
the new type is added.  Use any description that's meaningful to you.
<p>
<li><b>Extensions</b> are the file extensions that files of this type are typically 
identified by (if the file's MIME type is not available). You should separate 
multiple file extensions by commas. 
<p>
<li><b>Action</b> tells &browser.name; what to do with files of this type. 
There are four choices, as listed above.
<p>
<li><b>Application</b> is used whenever the Action is View in Application.
This is the external viewer that &browser.name; will invoke to view the
file. 
</ul>

<p>
For example, suppose you want to add a new file extension (.abc) to the 
list of Plain Text file extensions, so files with that extension will be 
treated as plain ASCII text. You can do this by selecting the Plain Text 
Content Type, adding ".abc" to the Extensions field, and clicking OK. 
Remember, however, that &browser.name; <i>first</i> looks to the file's
MIME type, not its extension. Thus, if a file with the new extension is 
sent from an http server to &browser.name; along with a MIME type, 
the file's extension will be ignored.

<p>
<a name="ContentType"></a>
<b>To add a new Content Type</b>, follow the steps below. These steps show 
an example of how you would add support for a type of images called 
raster images, using a viewer application called imagetool. You can use 
these steps to add support for any other file type and/or viewer application.
<ol>
<li>On the Content Viewer Preferences page, click <b>New</b>. 
<br>
This activates the MIME type fields at the right side of the page. Be sure 
to fill out these MIME type fields (Type and Subtype), as well as
the other fields to the right of the Content Types scrolling list. 
<p>
<li>Type a description of the content type in the <b>Description</b> field.
This is what will appear in the Content Types scrolling list when the new
type is added. 
<br>
For the raster file example, you might type <kbd>Raster File</kbd> in the 
Description field.
<p>
<li>Type the file <b>Extensions</b> that are usually in the names of files of 
this type. You should separate multiple file extensions by commas. 
<br>
For the raster file example, this might be <kbd><b>.</b>ras, <b>.</b>rs</kbd>.
<p>
<li>Select an <b>Action</b>. For this example, you would choose 
View in Application.
<p>
<li>If you chose View in Application, the <b>Application</b> type-in field
is activated. Type the name of the application, or click on the Choose
button to choose an application from your file system. 
<br>For the raster file example, you would type &nbsp;<kbd>imagetool</kbd>.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you type an application without the full path name where
the application is located on your file system, you <i>must</i> make sure
the exec.path property is set. (See <a href="viewer_execpath.html">Setting the 
exec.path Property</a>.) If you click Choose to select an application, the 
full path name is entered into the Application field, so you don't need to 
be concerned about the exec.path property for <i>this</i> particular 
application.
<p>
<li>Select the MIME <b>Type</b> for your new content type. Your choices are
Application, Audio, Image, Message, Multipart, Text, or Video.  For this 
example, choose Image.
<p>
<li>Select a MIME <b>Subtype</b> from the Subtype scrolling list, or type 
a description of the new content type after <b>x-</b> in the Subtype 
field. The scrolling list shows all the known subtypes for the specified
type. If none of the known subtypes is appropriate, type a description after
the x-. 
<br>
For the raster file example, you might type <kbd>x-rasterfile</kbd>.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you select a MIME Type/Subtype combination that is already
defined, your new definition (description, extensions, action, and 
application) will override the previous definition. 
<p>
<li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to activate your new Content Type. 
<p>
You should
see your new definition in the Content Types scrolling list, and you can now
access files of that type using the action you specified.
<p>
If your Action was <b>View in Application</b>, you'll notice that 
&browser.name; appends <b>%s</b> at the end of the Application definition 
when you click OK. 
It uses the %s later to substitute the actual file being opened.
</ol>

<p>
In some circumstances, &browser.name; creates temporary files to 
display content within the browser or to launch external applications. 
See <a href="viewer_tempfiles.html">Temporary Files for Content Viewer 
Applications</a>
for information about the location of these files, and how you can control
whether some of these files are automatically deleted.
