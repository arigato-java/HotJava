<p>

If you're running 
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix; 
in a networked environment and you're 
having trouble accessing Web pages, you might need to set proxy servers to 
enable access outside of your company network.  Proxies are the servers, or
gateways, for Internet access through your network firewall.  

<p>
Your system administrator may have already set up &browser.name; to
use proxies that are appropriate for your site.  If not, you can specify
proxy servers using the Proxy Preferences options.  

<p>
Although this is a somewhat advanced preference option, setting your 
proxies appropriately is necessary if you want to be able to access
sites outside of your company network. You may need to ask your system 
administrator for help with filling out the proxy preferences.  

<p>
<h2><a name="proxies">To Set Proxies</a></h2>
To access the Proxy Preferences, choose 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->General Preferences</nobr>.  On the General Preferences 
dialog box, select Proxies from the list on the left side.

<p>
When you type in a Web site address, the first part of the address
(the part before the "<b>:</b>", such as "http") is the
<i>Internet transfer protocol</i> of the page you are trying to access.
This indicates the page type and how the browser accesses the page.
Each type of protocol may use a different proxy server and port.  The
port is the "channel" the proxy server uses to listen for particular
types of communication requests.

<p>
&browser.name; supports the following protocols for which you may need to 
set proxies and ports.  
<ul>
<li>HTTP
<li>Security (HTTPS)
<li>FTP
<li>Gopher
</ul>

<p>
In addition to the protocols listed, you can also set a SOCKS proxy and port. 
SOCKS is another kind of server that allows access across a network 
firewall.  Ask your system administrator if you should be using SOCKS 
or the other proxy servers, or both, and the name and port of the appropriate 
servers. 
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Do not put values in the SOCKS field if you do not have a 
SOCKS server.  Doing so will prevent you from viewing pages outside your
company firewall, even if you have correct values in the protocol proxy
fields.

<p>
If you have specified proxies but you want to ignore the proxies when 
connecting
to particular hosts, such as those within your firewall, type the full host 
names in the <b>Bypass Proxies</b> text field. Full host names are in the form 
<tt>host.domain.</tt>
For example, type <tt>server.mycompany.com </tt>to connect directly
with the host <tt>server </tt>in the domain <tt>mycompany.com.</tt> 
Separate multiple names with spaces or carriage returns.

<p>
You can also specify that you want to bypass proxies for an entire domain 
by typing the domain name, starting with a period, in the Bypass Proxies 
field.
For example, type <nobr><wbr><tt><b>.</b>mycompany.com </tt></nobr>to 
bypass proxies for <i>all</i> hosts
in the <tt>mycompany.com </tt>domain.

In addition to the proxy settings, you can use Preferences pages to 
customize several other aspects of &browser.name;.  Follow these links for 
detailed information in the User's Guide about each of the possible Preferences
pages:
