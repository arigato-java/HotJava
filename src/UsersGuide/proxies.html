<p>

Use the Proxy Preferences 
to set your &browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font>
&browser.name.suffix; proxy servers, as described below. Choose 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->General Preferences</nobr>, then select Proxies from 
the options on the left side of the General Preferences dialog box. 
<p>
When you access a web page, &browser.name; tries by default to connect
directly to the machine specified in the address (or <i>URL</i>). If you're 
running &browser.name; on a company network, you may find that you can't 
access web pages outside your network. This is probably because your
company has set up a secure network <i>firewall</i> that can't be
penetrated except by going through a <i>proxy server</i>. Proxy servers
are programs that handle communication between a protected network and
the Internet at large.  These programs typically verify users and keep
a log of accesses.
<p>
<a name="ProxyServers"></a>
If you can't access web pages outside your network, you probably
need to specify proxy servers. You may need to ask your system
administrator for the name of the proxy server you should use, and the
corresponding <i>port</i>. The port is the "channel" the proxy uses to
listen for particular types of communications requests.
<p>
<a name="Cache"></a>
Another reason to use proxies is to improve performance and reduce
network traffic. Many proxy servers <i>cache</i> the pages you visit. 
Caching pages temporarily stores them to disk so they don't have to be 
downloaded across the network again when they are subsequently accessed.
If you have many requests on one network for the same web pages, caching 
the pages in a single place saves time. 
<p>
You may need to set a different proxy and port for each of the different
<a href="exploring.html#protocols">protocol types</a> 
(<b>HTTP</b>, <b>Security</b>, <b>FTP</b>, and <b>Gopher</b>), or you may
have to use the same proxy and port for each type. The Security proxy setting 
is used to access sites that start with the <b>HTTPS</b> protocol.  Your system 
administrator should tell you what you need.  

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name=dont.proxy></a>
You can bypass your proxies when connecting to designated hosts, such as 
hosts within your firewall. Type the names of the hosts you want to
connect to directly, without using proxies, in the <b>Bypass Proxies</b> 
text field. Use the full host name, in the form 
<nobr><wbr><i>server-name.domain-name</i></nobr> 
(for example, <b><kbd>myserver.mycompany.com</kbd></b>). 
Separate multiple entries by spaces or carriage returns. 
<p>
You can also designate entire domains in the Bypass Proxies field by 
entering a domain name that starts with a period. For example, type 
<kbd><b>.mycompany.com</b></kbd> to bypass the proxies for <i>all</i> 
hosts in the mycompany.com domain. 
<p>
If you haven't designated any proxies, you don't have to fill in the 
Bypass Proxies field. In this case, no proxies will be used at any time.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name="SOCKSServer"></a>
<b>SOCKS</b> is another kind of server that allows access across a
network firewall. Ask your system administrator if you should be using
SOCKS or the protocol proxy servers, or both, and the name of the appropriate 
servers.  Do not fill in values for the SOCKS server and port if you are
not using a SOCKS server. If you put values in the SOCKS fields without a
valid SOCKS server, &browser.name; will not be able to connect outside your 
firewall.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
&browser.name; supports NCSA 1.3.A and CERN 3.0 proxy servers, and later 
versions.
