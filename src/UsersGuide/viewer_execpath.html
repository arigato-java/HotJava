<b>Note:</b> The information on this page is for the Content Viewers 
feature, which is not available on all platforms.
If the <nobr><wbr>Edit->Content Viewer Preferences</nobr> 
option is missing, (for example, if you are running 
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix;
on the JavaStation<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> platform), the 
information on this page does not apply to your browser.

<p>
On the Content Viewer Preferences page, you can specify what &browser.name;
should do when it needs to display files of a particular type.  One
option is to launch an external application to display that content.
Whenever the <b>Action</b> listed for a particular content type is
<b>View in Application</b>, &browser.name; must be able to find the 
specified application.  &browser.name; is shipped with a default set of
application mappings that it tries to launch for various content types, but 
it cannot know where to find those applications on your system without 
you specifying the application locations.

<p>
<a name="ExecPathProperty"></a>
You <em>must</em> tell &browser.name; where on your system to find the external 
applications listed in the viewer application mappings.  You do this by setting 
the <b>exec.path</b> property in your &browser.name; properties file. 
(The exception is when you add a new content type, with the action View 
in Application, and you explicitly specify the full path name for the 
application. In this case you do not have to list that particular application's 
path in your exec.path property.) 

<p>
If you try to download a file and &browser.name; displays the message 
<b>Unable to Launch Viewer</b>, you probably do not have your exec.path 
property set correctly.
<p>
The exec.path property is a vertical bar-separated list of full 
directory names on your machine where &browser.name; should look for 
external viewer applications. 
<p>
Refer to the section below that corresponds to your platform for information
about setting the exec.path property for the supported set of viewer 
applications.

<h2>
Setting exec.path on Windows Systems<a name=win></a>
</h2>
On Windows systems, the properties file is in your home directory if the
environment variable HOME, HOMEDRIVE, or HOMEPATH is set. Otherwise it is:
<pre>
   <i>browser-install-directory</i>\.hotjava\properties
</pre>
Add the exec.path setting to this file. Note that you need to quit 
&browser.name; before editing this file, or else your edits will be lost 
when you later quit the current browser session.
<p>
A typical exec.path setting on Windows NT might be:
<pre>
   exec.path=c:\\winnt35\\system32|c:\\winnt35
</pre>
<p>
<b>Note the double \\'s in this property.</b> The backslash (<b>\</b>) is
the Escape character for the properties file. This means &browser.name; interprets
the character following a <b>\</b> literally. Whenever &browser.name; finds a 
<b>\</b> in the properties file, it ignores any special meanings for
the character that follows it. Since the <b>\</b> character itself has
a special meaning, you must use double backslash (<b>\\</b>) in the 
properties file to get a single backslash (<b>\</b>).

<p>
To ensure that &browser.name; can execute a basic set of applications that
&browser.name; might launch on Windows systems, make sure your 
exec.path property lists the paths for these applications: xanim, wordpad, 
acroread, and mplayer.

<h2>
Setting exec.path on Solaris<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> 
Systems <a name=solaris></a>
</h2>

On Solaris systems, your properties file is:
<pre>
   $HOME/.hotjava/properties
</pre>
Add the exec.path setting to this file. Note that you need to quit
&browser.name; before editing this file, or else your edits will be lost 
when you later quit the current browser session.
<p>
A typical setting of the exec.path property for Solaris users might be:
<pre>
   exec.path=/usr/bin|/usr/local/bin|/bin|/usr/dist/exe
</pre>

<p>
To ensure that &browser.name; can execute a common set of applications that
&browser.name; might launch on Solaris systems, make sure your exec.path 
property lists the paths for these applications: acroread, imagetool, 
xterm, troff, nroff, col, more, xdvi, audiotool, textedit, applix, and 
mpeg_play.
