<b>Note:</b> The information on this page is for the Content Viewers
feature, which is not available on all platforms.  If the 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->Content Viewers</nobr> option is missing,
(for example, if you are running 
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix;
on the JavaStation<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> platform), the
information on this page does not apply to your browser.
<p>

<h2><a name="ContentHandlers">Temporary Files for Content Handlers</a></h2>

When &browser.name; displays an application within the browser, it uses a 
content handler to do so.  A content handler may create temporary files.  
By default, these are created in the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory on 
Solaris<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> systems, or the 
<tt>c:\temp</tt> directory for Windows systems.  Windows users who do not 
have a <tt>c:\temp</tt> directory should edit the 
Java<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> runtime environment file:

<p>
<tt><i>hotjava-install-directory</i>\runtime\lib\content-types.properties</tt>
<p>

<a name="TempFileTemplateProperty"></a>
Change the <b>temp.file.template</b> property near the top of the file
to use an alternative directory for the temporary files.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> You should not edit the content-types.properties file other 
than to change the value of the temp.file.template property. Also, note that 
the "\" character is the escape character in this file. Therefore, to 
specify "\" in a directory name for Windows systems, you'll need to type "\\".

<p>
&browser.name; never deletes the temporary files created by
content handlers.

<p>
<a name="UnknownViewer"></a>
<h2>Temporary Files for Unknown Content Viewer Applications</h2>
When &browser.name; doesn't know how to handle content of a particular
type, it displays the "Unknown Viewer" page to ask you what
to do with the content.  If you specify that an application should be
launched, a temporary file is created to pass the data to the application.
In this case, temporary files are created in one of the following directories:

<ol>
<li>If possible, they are put in a <tt>temp</tt> subdirectory of the 
<tt>.hotjava</tt> directory. The <tt>.hotjava</tt> directory is placed 
in your home directory if you have one. Windows users without home directories 
will find the <tt>.hotjava</tt> directory under the directory where 
&browser.name; is installed.

<p>
<li>If that fails, the temporary files are created in the directory specified 
by the HOTJAVA_HOME environment variable.

<p>
<li>If that fails, they are created in the directory in which &browser.name;
was started.
</ol>

<p>
By default, &browser.name; does not delete these temporary files.
This is because some applications, especially on Solaris systems, 
spawn other applications that try to access them. If &browser.name; 
deletes the temporary file after the application it creates is
finished, and that application has started another application, 
the child application may attempt to read the temporary file after it 
has been deleted.

<p>
<a name="ViewerUnknownDeleteProperty"></a>
If you know that the applications you launch do not create child applications, 
you can safely change &browser.name; to delete the temporary files it creates. 
To do so, add the following property to your properties file (described below): 

<pre>
  viewerunknown.delete.tmpfile=true 
</pre>

<b>On Windows systems</b>, the properties file is in your home directory if the
environment variable HOME, HOMEDRIVE, or HOMEPATH is set. Otherwise it is:

<pre>
  <i>hotjava-install-directory</i>\.hotjava\properties
</pre>

Add the viewerunkown.delete.tmpfile=true property to this file. Note that you 
need to quit &browser.name; before editing this file, or else your edits will be 
lost when you later quit the current browser session.

<p>
<b>On Solaris systems,</b> your properties file is:

<pre>
  $HOME/.hotjava/properties
</pre>

Add the viewerunkown.delete.tmpfile=true property to this file. Note that you need 
to quit &browser.name; before editing this file, or else your edits will be 
lost when you later quit the current browser session.
