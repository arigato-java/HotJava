<p>

Use the <b>Text Preferences</b> to change the display and printing of text in 
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix;. 

<p>
Access the text preferences by choosing 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->General Preferences</nobr>, then selecting Text from the
list of options on the left side of the General Preferences dialog box. The 
text preferences items are then displayed on the right.
<p>

<a name="Typeface"></a>
<b>Screen Font</b> and <b>Size</b> set the text font and size used by 
&browser.name; to display <a href="exploring.html#HTML">HTML</a> pages. 
These settings affect normal HTML text, but they do not affect the text in 
applets running on your page. You may also find that some pages have "text" 
that is actually in a graphic, and thus is not affected by the typeface 
display settings.
<p>

<a name="PrintTypeface"></a>
<b>Printer Font</b> and <b>Size</b> set the text font
and size used to print pages. Different options are provided for screen
display and printed output to allow for differing requirements for optimal 
text display.  For example, you may want a smaller type size for printed 
output than you want for screen display, or you may prefer fonts without 
serifs for screen display, and fonts with serifs for printed display.  
(Serifs are fine lines that "finish off" the main strokes of a letter, 
such as the horizontal line at the bottom of the letter "p" when displayed 
in a serif typeface.)

<p>
If a page cannot be printed in the specified Printer Font Size without 
"chopping off" some wide text, such as tables or preformatted HTML text 
(for example, code samples), the page will be printed with a scaled-down 
type size. You may want to try printing such pages in Landscape mode in 
order to successfully print the page using the specified Printer Font Size.

<a name=visited.links></a>
<p>
When you visit a link, the color of the link (the underline) changes to
remind you that you've recently visited that link.  By default, the color
reverts back to the unvisited link color after 14 days.
Use the <b>Visited Links Expire After</b> text field to change the number of
days before the link color reverts back. Click <b>Expire Now</b> 
to force the links to expire immediately.

<p>
Use the <b><a name="Links">Underline Links</a></b> option to specify whether
HTML hypertext links are underlined.  When the Underline Links option is not
selected, hypertext links are displayed in a different color.  When the
Underline Links option is selected, links are both a different color and 
underlined.  The default is to have links underlined. In either case, when 
a link has previously been followed, the color of the link changes.

<a name=blink></a>
<p>
Some HTML pages contain a tag that tells a section of text to blink.
For example, 
<blink>this text blinks</blink> (if the HTML blink tag is honored).
By default, &browser.name; does honor the request to display
blinking text.  If you do not want to see blinking text, select the 
<b>Turn Off Blinking Text</b> option.
