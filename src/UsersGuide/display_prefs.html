<p>

Use the <b><a name="DisplayPrefs">Display Preferences</a></b> to: 
<ul>
<li>Specify the contents of your home page and startup page
<li>Change the location and appearance of 
&browser.name.prefix;<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> &browser.name.suffix; 
buttons and fields
<li>Specify whether to automatically display images, animations, and 
Java<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> applets
</ul>
<p>
Access the Display Preferences by selecting 
<nobr><wbr>Edit->General Preferences</nobr>.  By default, the Display
Preferences panel is automatically shown on the General Preferences dialog box.

<p>
<a name=home.page></a>
When &browser.name; is started, and when you click the Home button, your 
&browser.name; <b>Home Page</b> is displayed. To change this home page, 
type a new <a href="exploring.html#urls">address</a> in the Home Page 
Address field. 

<p>
<a name="BlankPage"></a>
By default, your Home Page is the first page that &browser.name; displays
when it starts.
For performance reasons, you can choose to have &browser.name; display 
a blank page at startup by choosing <b>Blank Page</b>
as the <b>Browser Starts At</b> option.  
&browser.name; will still display the Home Page whenever you click 
the Home button. 

<p>
<b><a name="ButtonAppearance">Show Toolbar Buttons As</a></b> allows you 
to customize the content of the toolbar buttons.  By default, the 
buttons contain both images and text, but you can choose to have them 
only display one or the other if you prefer to have smaller buttons.

<p>
The <a name="ScreenLayout"><b>Screen Layout</b></a> options allow you to 
customize the location of the buttons, Address field, and status bar.
<ul>
<li>
Use the <b><a name="NavButtons">Buttons</a></b> pulldown menu choices 
to display the buttons at the top (the default), bottom, left, or right 
of the browser window, or not at all. If you don't display the buttons, 
you can still use menu items to perform all of the button functions.
<p>
<li>
The <b><a name="Locator">Address</a></b> field is where you type the address 
(also known as the URL) of a place you want to visit.  Use the Address pulldown 
menu to place the Address field at the top or bottom of the window. You can 
also choose None if you don't want to display the address field in the window. 
You can still display an Address field in a separate <nobr><wbr>pop-up</nobr>
window by choosing either <nobr><wbr>File->Open</nobr> or Open from the right
mouse button pop-up menu.
<p>
<li>
The <b><a name="StatusBar">Status Bar</a></b> is the area where all the 
&browser.name; status and error messages are displayed. To the left of the
status bar is the <a href="security.html#lock">lock</a>, indicating whether 
the current page has been loaded using the secure https protocol.  To the 
right of the status bar is a clock (unless you have chosen not to display 
the clock in <a href="clock_prefs.html">Clock Preferences</a>).
<p>
By default, the Status Bar appears in the footer. 
You can choose to move the Status Bar to the header, or not display it at all.
</ul>

<p>
<a name=PlayGif></a>
Deselect the <b>Play GIF Animations</b> option if you want to disable 
&browser.name; from playing GIF animations on displayed pages in order to
improve loading and scrolling performance, or if you find the animation of 
a particular image annoying.  
<p>
Animated GIF images are images that change their appearance in a continuous 
cycle.  
<p>
For example, this is an animated GIF image: <img src="anim.gif"> 
<p>
The Play GIF Animations setting will only affect animations
on pages (such as the animated image above).  The
animation in the upper right corner of the browser that indicates when a page
is being loaded is <i>not</i> affected by this setting. 

<p>
Use the <b><a name="ConfirmQuit">Confirm on Exit</a></b> option to specify whether
you would like &browser.name; to display a confirmation notice when you choose
<nobr><wbr>File->Exit</nobr> on the only open &browser.name; window.  
This gives you a chance to verify that you really want 
to exit the application.  The default is to display the confirmation notice.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
Deselect the <b><a name=delay.images>Automatically Load Images</a></b>
option if you don't want to automatically load all images on pages when they
are loaded. Choose this option to improve the loading time of pages with a 
lot of images, or pages with images you're not interested in seeing.
<p>
When Automatically Load Images is <i>not</i> selected, you'll see the following 
icon in place of every unloaded image:
<p>
<a name="UnloadedImage"><img src="doc:/lib/images/image-delayed.gif"> Unloaded 
Image icon</a>
<p>
The size of the panel containing this icon shows how large the image will be
when it's loaded.  Click the icon when you want to load the image.
<p>
If the author of the page specified alternative text for the unloaded image
(using the ALT tag), that text will be displayed next to the Unloaded Image
icon. This can help you identify whether you want to load the image.
<p>
If Automatically Load Images is not selected and you'd like to load all the
images on the current page, select the Automatically Load Images 
option, click OK, and <a href="menus.html#reload">reload</a> the page.
The images will not be loaded until the page is reloaded.
<p>
Note that you may see the Unloaded Image icon if &browser.name; times out
when loading an image, even if the Automatically Load Images option is 
selected. Click the Unloaded Image icon to restart image loading.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
Deselect the <b><a name=delay.applets>Automatically Load Java Applets</a></b>
option if you don't want &browser.name; to automatically
load all applets on a page as it loads the page. You might choose this option
to improve the loading time of a page with a lot of applets, or a page
with an applet you're not interested in seeing.
<p>
When Automatically Load Java Applets is <i>not</i> selected, you'll see the 
following icon in place of an unloaded applet:
<p>
<a name="UnloadedApplet"><img src="doc:/lib/images/applet-delayed.gif"> Unloaded
Applet icon</a>
<p>
The size of the panel containing the icon shows how large the applet will be
when it's loaded.
Click the icon when you want to load the applet. Watch the message area
to see the progress of the applet loading.
<p>
If the Automatically Load Java Applets option is not selected and you'd like 
to load all the applets on the current page at once, select the Automatically 
Load Java Applets option, click OK, and then 
<a href="menus.html#reload">reload</a> the page.

<p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name=show_bookmarks></a>
Use the <b>Show Personal Bookmarks in Bookmarks Menu</b> option to control
the contents of the <a href="menus.html#bookmarks_menu">Bookmarks</a> menu.  
By default, all the bookmarks in your Personal Bookmarks list are listed
at the end of the menu, (after Go to Bookmark).  If this makes your Bookmarks
menu too long or cumbersome, you can deselect the Show Personal Bookmarks
in Bookmarks Menu option.  The Bookmarks menu then will only contain the top 
four standard menu items, ending with Go to Bookmark.  You can still access 
your Personal Bookmarks list by using the Edit Bookmarks window, or using the 
File Bookmarks and Go to Bookmarks submenus.
